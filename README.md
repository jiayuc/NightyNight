### Virtual Buildings
We added the social aspect by creating a virtual building where each friend is represented with a window with light on/off to indicate the sleeping status. 
Each building represent a friend group.

### Grouped friend list
You can add friends by looking up users with their emails. They will receive friend request in drop-down notification.

### Real-time chat
Nighty-night has a real-time chat system I implemented using Firebase; users can tap on the virtual windows of their
friends to chat or leave good morning messages for them to find out the next day
